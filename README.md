# 🌐 Machine Learning Learning Environment

This project was developed as part of my senior capstone with two other classmates, [Samuel Barney](https://github.com/sbarn-okstate) and [Mark Taylor](https://github.com/mark101tay). It is an educative and interactive web-application that allows users to create their own machine learning model.
