# 👋 Welcome!

Welcome! This repository is a fork of my senior capstone, Machine Learning Learning Environment (MLLE), developed with two classmates, [Samuel Barney](https://github.com/sbarn-okstate) and [Mark Taylor](https://github.com/mark101tay). MLLE is an educative and interactive web-application that allows users to create and experiment with their own machine learning models.
